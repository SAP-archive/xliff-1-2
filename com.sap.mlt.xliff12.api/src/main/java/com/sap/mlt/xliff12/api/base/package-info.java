/**
 * Contains basic interfaces that are extended by actual XLIFF attribute-
 * and element-interfaces.
 * <p>
 * While you don't work directly with the basic interfaces in this package,
 * the interfaces are a "type-nature" hint for attributes and elements. For
 * example all so-called "xtendable" attributes extend the
 * {@link com.sap.mlt.xliff12.api.base.XTendableAttribute} interface.
